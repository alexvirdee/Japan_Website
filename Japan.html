<h2>Tokyo</h2>
	<img src="assets/images/tokyo-resize.jpg" class="tokyo-image" alt="Shibuya Crossing!">
		<p>Most people will start their journey in Japan in the captivating city of Tokyo. They might find themselves eating seafood and sushi at Tsukiji fish market, on top of the tallest tower in the world (Tokyo Sky tree), or just strolling the streets in awe of its impressive architecture and wonderful lights at night. It’s safe to say at least from my experience, that some of the friendliest people in the world live here in Tokyo. It is full of life and anyone who visits can tell you that this city is incredibly impressive and vibrant thanks to its people. Everyone here seems to have a friendly aura to them, always happy even in an exceedingly fast paced environment.</p>

		<p>If there is one place you must see while in Tokyo, it must be Shibuya crossing. Although it is essentially just a crosswalk it’s amazing to see how crowded the street gets every time the pedestrians have the right of way and just how incredibly chaotic yet organized it is which is just mind-blowing! </p>

		<footer>* Great photo opportunity of this event if you go to the second floor of the Starbucks directly adjacent to Shibuya crossing. Also, Shibuya is great to visit at night! </footer>

<div id="Kyoto">
<h2>Kyoto</h2>
		
		<img src="assets/images/gion-resize.jpg" class="gion-image" alt="Gion District">
	<div id="kyoto-paragraph">
		<p>No list of top places to see in Japan would be complete without having Kyoto on it. If you want to experience Japan in a way that seems like you are there when Samurais were still walking around, it is a must to come here. If you are lucky enough you may be able to spot geisha’s (geiko referring to ones from Kyoto) walking around in their traditional Japanese Kimono. To increase your chances of seeing them as well as enjoying some amazing food and shopping, you’ll need to head to the Gion district of Kyoto as seen in the photo above. </p>

		<img src="assets/images/kinkakuji-resize.jpg" class="kinkakuji" alt="Kinkaku-Ji"> 
<div id="kinkakuji-p">
		 <p>Kinkaku-Ji (above photo) must be one of the coolest looking temples that I have ever visited. As soon as you make way through the initial line at the entrance you’ll be amazed by the gold colored temple giving you a Zen like experience. </p> 

		<p>Arashiyama is also another place in Kyoto you should not miss. It is a bamboo forest where you can also spot monkeys and it is an impressive site but you should make sure to get there early as it is difficult to see the forest at night. </p>

<div id="fishimi-p">
		<p>Lastly, in Kyoto as places I would recommend to see would be Fushimi Inari. Although I am not the biggest fan of huge tourist attractions (which this certainly is) with its Shinto shrine & famed Torii gates, this place is too impressive to miss out on. </p>

		<footer>*You’ll have to walk up a pathway consisting of its thousands of Torii gates to get to a point where you won’t get another tourist in one of your pictures. It may be a long walk but it’s worth it so try to get to this site early to increase your chances of better photos! </footer>

<div id="Hiroshima">
<h2>Hiroshima</h2>

 <img src="assets/images/hiroshima-resize.jpg" class="hiroshima" alt="Atomic Bomb Dome"> 

	
		<p>The city of Hiroshima was one of the cities that was destroyed by an atomic bomb during World War II. As you walk around the city you will be able to see remnants of this disastrous event that took place in history. The atomic bomb dome gives you a chance to see first hand one of the buildings that has stood the test of time and is now designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. While in Hiroshima you must check the Peace Memorial Museum to really understand the devastating effects the atomic bomb caused to the city. </p>

		<p>Not all of Hiroshima is surrounded by the sad consequence of the bombings that happened in WWII. To experience some amazing sites that Japan has to offer you should check out Miyajima which is a small island less than an hour outside of Hiroshima. You can taste some of the amazing seafood (oysters are popular here) and take a gondola ride up the top of the mountain of the island. The island is also known for the Itsukushima Shrine or the “Great Torii” as it is commonly referred to. It is also a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

		<footer>*The gate is also the boundary between the human world and the spirit world; cool if you ask me! </footer>

<div id="Tottori">
<h2>Tottori</h2>
	
		<p>The prefecture of Tottori is one of the most amazing places in Japan that most people have never heard of, even many Japanese do not even know about this hidden gem! </p>

		<p>Tottori has an amazing geographical feature; sand dunes that are created by sediment deposits carried from the mountains. The dunes have existed for thousands of years and it makes for an incredible tourist attraction even though many people I’ve spoken too did not even know Japan had their very own “desert”. </p>

		<footer>*Make sure to make this one of your destinations if you visit Japan, the dunes are shrinking and it’s inevitable that they will one day be gone. </footer>

<div id="Hakuba">
<h2>Hakuba</h2>
	
		<p>Near the valley of Nagano is a snow town called Hakuba, this city boasts several ski areas and is worth a visit if you are trying to some snowboarding or skiing for a weekend. The slopes are full of powder and it’s a once in a lifetime experience being able to snowboard on the Japanese Alps! </p>

		<p>The 1998 Winter Olympics was held here in Hakuba, skiing here really is world class and an unforgettable experience. Make sure to visit one of the many onsens in the area they are perfect after a long day on the slopes!</p>
